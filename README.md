This is the source for the commitee.bitshares.works website.

This site is currently available in English and Chinese languages.

Due to limitations of Jekyll plugin use in github pages, multilingual support has been hacked around vanilla Jekyll and requires a small amount of manual work:

a) Each page or post must have mapping entries in _data/map.yml
b) Pagination placeholder front matter pages must be created by hand (new page number folder created with index.html carrying the new page number index)

This site is currently maintained by BitShares Committee members: @clockwork & @jademont.
