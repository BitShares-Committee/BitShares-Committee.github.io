title: "[Update]|Blockchain Fees reduced drastically"

As of Tuesday, January 9th 2018, the transaction fees on BitShares have
drastically been reduced by the BitShares Committee.

Due to the increase of the unit price of BTS on all major exchanges, a
reduction of the fee was desperately requested by community members,
users and businesses. After having approached the BitShares committee, a
proposal (`1.10.7264`) was been made to actually reduce the transaction
fee which quickly was approved by the majority of committee members.

The fees have been adjusted to the fee schedule proposed and described
on [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitShares-Committee/Instructions/master/usd-denominated-fees/config.py).

The fees can be found on the blockchain using [bitshares.eu](https://wallet.bitshares.eu/explorer/fees).

As of today, the actual fees for most transaction types are:
