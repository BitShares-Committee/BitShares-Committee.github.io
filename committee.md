## The Committee
The BitShares Committee comprises a board that provides governance over the BitShares blockchain. They have control over blockchain parameters such as block size, block time, witness pay, and over 30 others. Additionally, the Committee can change the fee schedule which defines the minimum fee for each operation offered by the system. Finally, the Committee makes suggestions and management decisions through on-chain consensus to provide guidance and direction to the BitShares development efforts. Voters can cast a vote for how many members the committee should constitute as well as vote for a particular set of members.


The current BitShares Committee members can be viewed at the relevant BitShares reference wallet page [here](https://wallet.bitshares.org/#/explorer/committee-members).

**Make sure you vote for your preferred Committee members or set a proxy you trust to vote on your behalf.**
