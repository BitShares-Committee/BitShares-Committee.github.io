title: "[Proposal]|Claim market fees from bitCNY"
---

A new Committee proposal to claim the 80,000 bitCNY in fees has been created.

You can follow the voting [here](https://cryptofresh.com/p/1.10.8835).

We would like to remind everyone that those fees are the result of [this proposal](http://committee.bitshares.works/2018/03/10/market-fees-approved/) and will be used to support the bitCNY market as described in [this forum post](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26072.0)

Thank you.
