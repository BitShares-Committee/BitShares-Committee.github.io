title: "[Announcement]|Bitshares Blockchain Foundation launches BitShares' Public Presentation plan"
---

Hello everyone,

The BBF is planning to propose a complete overhaul of BitShares' public image in terms of associated domains, websites, content and documentation in order to bring everything up to date, and in line with legal requirements.

This was the first project the BitShares Committee cooperated in order to formulate the proposal with the BBF on  and will hopefully be only the beginning of a series of coordinated actions to help the BitShares platform grow.

You can read more about the proposal at BBF's [worker announcement](http://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2018-04-general-presentation).

You can also join in the [relevant discussion](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26167.0) at bitsharestalk.org.

Thank you.
