Hello everyone,

Committee member **bitcrab** has opened a new topic for discussion in [bitsharestalk.org](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26107.0).

He suggests using part of the unspent daily reserve budget to adjust the supply of smartcoins and BTS through a Committee-controlled worker.

*Please take part in the discussion.*

Thank you.
