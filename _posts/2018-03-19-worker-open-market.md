title: "[Proposal]|Proposal to create worker for open market operation fund"
---

Hello everyone,

The Committee is currently voting on a proposal to create the worker described in [this forum post](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26107.0) at bitsharestalk.org.

The worker is set to receive 200k daily of the currently remaining 240k daily budget to support smartcoin markets as explained in the link above.

Once the proposal is approved by the Committee and the neccessary review period passes, the worker will be created and be subject to BTS holders' voting approval like any other worker.

Thank you.
