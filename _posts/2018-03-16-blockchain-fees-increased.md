title: "[Update]|Blockchain fees increased"
---

As of Friday, March 16th 2018, the transaction fees on BitShares have
been increased by the BitShares Committee.

Due to the decrease of the unit price of BTS on all major exchanges, an increase 
of the fees was required to align with the agreed upon USD values.
After discussions, the BitShares committee created a
proposal (`1.10.8736`) to actually increase the transaction
fees which was quickly approved by the majority of committee members.

The fees have been adjusted to the fee schedule proposed and described
on [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitShares-Committee/Instructions/master/usd-denominated-fees/config.py).

The fees can be found on the blockchain using [bitshares.eu](https://wallet.bitshares.eu/explorer/fees).

As of today, the actual fees for most transaction types are:
