title: "[Proposal]|Introducing 0.1% trade fee on BitCNY & bitUSD"
---

Hello everyone,

The Committee is currently voting on the proposal to introduce a 0.1% market fee on bitUSD and bitCNY and use the proceeds to adjust their supply as well as that of BTS through the mechanism suggested by Commitee member **bitcrab**. For example, when a trader would get 1000 CNY by selling another asset e.g. BTS, 1 CNY will be charged.

You can view the discussion leading to the proposal [here](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26072.0).

Thank you.
