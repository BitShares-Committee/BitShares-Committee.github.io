Hello everyone,

The following is an update regarding committee actions over the last month and a half or so.

As fas as the market operations budget is concerned, the accounting is as follows:

**Funding:**  
2,000,000 BTS *from committee reserves.*  
5,618,000 BTS *from the "committee controlled open market operation fund" worker.*  
67,700 bitUSD *from the bitUSD market fees.*  
1,314,000 bitCNY *from the bitCNY market fees.*  

The [bitUSD operations account](https://wallet.bitshares.org/#/account/committee-usdoperator) has received the 67,700 bitUSD from market fees + 1,890,000 BTS.  
The [bitCNY operations account](https://wallet.bitshares.org/#/account/committee-cnytrader) has received the 1,314,000 bitCNY from market fees + 5,780,000 BTS.

Both operations accounts are providing added bitAsset liquidity with their CR carefully kept around the 3.5 - 4 mark.  
Specifically, bitUSD operation has added an extra 234,000 bitUSD to the market (approx. 1.5% of the total bitUSD supply).  
Similarly, bitCNY operation has added an extra 4,890,000 bitCNY to the market (approx. 1.8% of the total bitCNY supply).

At first glance, the operations appear to have had a positive effect on the market with added liquidity (combined with the efforts of the market-making DEXbot users) as well as an increase in daily volumes.

A more thorough review will be made available once some more time passes since one month is not a large enough sample.

In other news, the first Graphene DevCon was succesfully concluded in Shanghai over the last weekend. Committee member jademont has [published a relevant article](https://steemit.com/graphene/@jademont/global-graphene-blockchain-devcon-is-successfully-concluded).
