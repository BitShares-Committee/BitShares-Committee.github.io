<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to the BitShares Committee news and updates page.
</p>
<p>
  This is a <strong>work in progress</strong>, aiming to be the hub of all Committee related information.
  <br/> For the time being it will contain information about Committee proposals, voting reports and announcements.
</p>
<p>
    More importantly, this page enables web push notifications so please <strong>ACCEPT</strong> and <strong>ALLOW</strong> notifications from this site if you
    want to be kept up-to-date about Committee matters.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those on systems were web-push notifications don't work, or who prefer not enabling them, updates are also streamed to <a href="https://t.me/BitSharesCommitteeNews" target="_blank">t.me/BitSharesCommitteeNews</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please bear with us while we fill the site with archived content and
    <strong>don't forget to vote</strong> for workers, committee members and witnesses, or set a proxy you trust.
