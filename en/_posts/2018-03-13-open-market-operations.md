Hello everyone,

Following on from his [earlier proposal](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26072.0) to introduce a 0.1% fee to the bitUSD & bitCNY markets and use the proceeds to help liquidity in those markets, Committee member **bitcrab** has opened a new topic for discussion in [bitsharestalk.org](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26107.0).

He suggests using part of the unspent daily reserve budget to adjust the supply of smartcoins and BTS through a Committee-controlled worker by utilising it in the same manner as the proceeds from fees mentioned above.

We would like to remind you that the 0.1% fee and associated market value management operation was [proposed](/2018/03/09/bitXXX-Market-Fees-Proposal/) and [approved](/2018/03/10/market-fees-approved/).

*Please take part in the discussion.*

Thank you.
