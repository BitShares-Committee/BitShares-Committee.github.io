Hello everyone,

The Committee is currently voting on the proposal to introduce a 0.1% market fee on bitUSD and bitCNY and use the proceeds to adjust their supply as well as that of BTS through the mechanism suggested by Commitee member **bitcrab**. For example, when a trader would get 1000 CNY by selling another asset, e.g. BTS, 1 CNY will be charged.

You can view the discussion leading to the proposal at [bitsharestalk.org](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26072.0).

Thank you.
