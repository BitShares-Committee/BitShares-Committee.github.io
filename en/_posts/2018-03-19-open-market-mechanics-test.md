Hello everyone,

If you have followed the [relevant discussion](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26107.0) in the bitsharestalk.org forums, you will know there is a suggestion to use a committee-controlled worker to support the bitXXX markets using the remainder of the daily budget. If not, please read and take part in the discussion linked above.

In order to test the results of such a worker, the Committee is voting on a proposal to transfer 2m BTS from committee-account to committee-cnytrader (a multisig account of the chinese constituency of the Committee) so a test-run of the mechanics can be perfomed in bitCNY.

You can follow the voting [here](https://cryptofresh.com/p/1.10.8836).

In the interests of transparency, those 2m BTS in committee-account are the result of a BitSILVER black-swan event as explained [here](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26072.msg316910#msg316910)

Thank you.
