Hello everyone,

In the interests of transparency and to solve the issue of Committee proposals/decisions not being publicised enough, the Committee has launched this website under the [committee.bitshares.works](http://committee.bitshares.works) domain (provided by the BBF) to serve as the central hub of Committee related information.

All Committee proposals, suggestions, announcements and voting results will be published here with links to relevant information as well as to relevant discussion in the forums so the community can share its suggestions and concerns.

Furthermore, we have enabled web push notifications on this site so please make sure you **ACCEPT** and **ALLOW** notifications from this site so you can be immediately informed of any updates.

Thank you.
